# Template for React application

This template contains all the required logic for initial application on React.

## Guide on how to use this template

1. Replace globally `APP_NAME` to your **project name** you want to use (e.g. `versuspoker`)
2. Add necessary environment variables (e.g. API_URL) to `.env.development`
3. Find all `// TODO (template preparation)` and handle them
4. Remove this instruction and replace it with the template from **PROJECT_README**
